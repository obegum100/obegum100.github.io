  Click Count

  After the user clicks #click-me:

  1. Increment the variable count by 1 (think back to calculator-box)
  2: Update the UI by changing the HTML in #click-num to the new value of count
  3: If count === 5, change the background-color of <body> to red
  4: Else if count === 10, change the background-color of <body> to green
  5: Else if count === 15, change the background-color of <body> to blue
  6: Else, change the background-color of <body> to black

  HINT: Just like calculator-box, use the variable count (declared for you below) to keep track of the user's clicks

var count = 0

$('#click-me').click(/* What goes here?! */)

function clickCount() {

}
